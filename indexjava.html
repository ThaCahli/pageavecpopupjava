	<h2>I hope you ready for this</h2>

	<h1>I'm not even at 100%</h1>

	<h3>before you ask why take a f****** deep breathe</h3>	 

	<p>Don't be mad at me i'm just slicker than your average, and I MEAN it. Seriously if people can't handle the truth, please just quit 	that's only a warm up but i have a lot od respect for you guys who showed up before me and did the job. You did it well so i'm just 		improving it</p>

	<p>It's not about the computer ( mine is a old dell , the battery stamina is so weak right now i'm speeding LMFAO)
No need to put lot of money on a computer if you can use it, that's useless. Start by reading books can also watch vid√©o on youtube 		there a lot of tutorial you can learn. After that you will have skills.</p>
